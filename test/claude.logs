Starting Live Mutex broker concurrency tests
✓ Broker started on port 7777

Test 1: Multiple clients competing for the same lock
(node:67897) MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 exit listeners added to [process]. MaxListeners is 10. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
  Created 10 clients
  Client acquired lock, count: 1
  Client acquired lock, count: 2
  Client acquired lock, count: 3
  Client acquired lock, count: 4
  Client acquired lock, count: 5
  Client acquired lock, count: 6
  Client acquired lock, count: 7
  Client acquired lock, count: 8
  Client acquired lock, count: 9
  Client acquired lock, count: 10
✓ Test 1 passed: All 10 clients acquired and released the lock

Test 2: Semaphore with multiple holders
✓ Test 2 passed: Max concurrent holders: 3, limit was 3

Test 3: Concurrent lock and unlock operations
✓ Test 3 passed: 20 operations completed successfully

Test 4: Lock expiration
  First client acquired lock (will expire)
  Waiting for lock to expire...
lmx broker warning: No "warning" event handlers attached by end-user to the broker emitter, therefore logging these errors from library:
lmx broker warning: lmx broker warning [2]: lock object timed out for key => "expiring-lock-test"
lmx broker warning: Add a "warning" event listener to the lmx broker emitter to get rid of this message.
  Second client acquired lock after expiration
✓ Test 4 passed: Lock properly expired and was acquired by second client

Test 5: Client disconnection
  Disposable client acquired lock
  Closing disposable client without unlocking
lmx client warning: No "warning" event handler(s) attached by end-user to client.emitter, therefore logging these errors from LMX library:
lmx client warning: lmx client stream "close" event occurred.
lmx client warning: Add a "warning" event listener to the lmx client to get rid of this message.
  Second client acquired lock after disconnection
✓ Test 5 passed: Lock properly released after client disconnection

Test 6: Forced unlocks
  First client acquired lock
lmx client warning: No "warning" event handler(s) attached by end-user to client.emitter, therefore logging these errors from LMX library:
lmx client warning: lmx client lock request timed out after 3000 ms, 0 retries attempted to acquire lock for key "forced-unlock-test".
lmx client warning: Add a "warning" event listener to the lmx client to get rid of this message.
  Second client force-unlocked the lock
  Second client acquired lock after force-unlock
✓ Test 6 passed: Force unlock worked correctly

Test 7: Rapid lock/unlock cycles
  Completed 50 out of 50 lock/unlock cycles
✓ Test 7 passed: Completed 50/50 rapid lock/unlock cycles

✓ All tests completed successfully
