This (temporary) directory was created because you have yet to create a suman helpers directory,
or it was deleted. When running "suman --init", a directory called "suman" is created at the root of your project.
You can move this directory as desired, as long as you update suman.conf.js accordingly.
Please see these instructions on how to remedy the situation:
