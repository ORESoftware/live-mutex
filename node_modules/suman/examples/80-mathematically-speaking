// Mathematically speaking Suman tests run according to these time rules

if all tests are run in parallel processes, all starting all the same time, where x is the time it takes to complete
a particular test

```
time to complete approaches MAX(x,...X)
```

if all tests are run in series (you can do this two ways, using your suman.conf.js file you can specify
a maximum of one process running at a time, *or* you can use your suman.order.js configuration file to handle
blocking between processes running particular tests.).

```
time to complete approaches SUM(x,...X)
```
