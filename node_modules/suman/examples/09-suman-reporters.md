Suman allows you to create custom reporters. You can add customer reporters and reference them in your suman.conf.js file at the root
of your project. Then use command line options to select which reporters to use.

If Suman cannot find your reporter (because it's not installed, for instance), Suman will fail-fast with a useful error message.
