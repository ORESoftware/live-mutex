# How to start contributing to Suman

Please use the dev branch as the base branch to make changes.

Master is the branch that mirrors NPM. Staging is a temporary branch that is used to submit PRs to master.
Once you submit the PR to master, CI/CD tests will run, then if they pass, we delete staging.

You can use this tool to clone all the SumanJS projects onto your machine:

This project will run the ./build.sh file and ./contribute.sh file in each project.
