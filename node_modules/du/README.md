# node-du
A simple JavaScript / Node.js implementation of `du -sb`. Available in npm as *du*

```js
require('du')('/home/rvagg/.npm/', function (err, size) {
  console.log('The size of /home/rvagg/.npm/ is:', size, 'bytes')
})
```

Also comes with a `dujs` command if installed with `npm install du -g`, just in case `du -sb` was too many 2 too many characters for you to type.

## options

An optional `options` object may be passed as the second argument. Currently there is only two options,
a `'filter'` function that is passed a full file path and is expected to return a truthy/falsy value to indicate whether the file is included in size calculations
and a `disk` option. If disk is true, then block sizing is used when calculating the size. (get's you closer to real du numbers).

```js
du(
    '/tmp/foo.leveldb/'
  , { filter: function (f) { return /\.sst$/.test(f) } }
  , function (err, size) {
      console.log('The size of the sst files in /tmp/foo.leveldb/ is:', size, 'bytes')
    }
)
```
