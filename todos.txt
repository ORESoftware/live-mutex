* clients should be given an array of host/port combinations to try to connect to

* priority lock request should be put at front of queue

* provide option to just use lockUuid, and not unlock fn

* lck.notify array should be a key/value hash

* allow lock-requestors to force their way to obtaining a lock
similar to unlock-requestors being able to force unlock even if they don't have the key

* unlock may be callable more than once, that should not happen.

* on disconnection we could delete wsClientId key/val from this.wsToKeys
 but there should be no real need to do that since we won't have that many clients
